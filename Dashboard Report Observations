Regional Performance Analysis:
Revenue vs. Profit Correlation:
The Central region has the highest revenue ($4.7M) but also leads in profit ($0.48M), indicating efficient cost management and high-margin sales.
The South region, having the lowest revenue ($3.2M), achieves the second-highest profit ($0.42M), suggesting a strong focus on profitability over volume.
The West and East regions have comparable revenue but differ in profit. Strategies to optimize margins in these regions could improve profitability.

Shipping Costs vs. Revenue:
•	The South and West regions incur the highest shipping costs ($25.79K each) but generate relatively lower revenue compared to the Central region. This highlights a potential inefficiency in logistics or higher operational costs.

Product Performance Analysis:
1.	Revenue by Product Category:
o	Technology contributes the highest revenue ($6.0M) and unit price ($0.37M), making it the top-performing category. Efforts to further enhance sales in this category could yield significant returns.
o	Office Supplies, despite being the lowest revenue contributor ($4.0M), may have potential for growth through bundling or cross-selling strategies.
o	
2.	Base Margin by Product Container:
o	Medium containers yield the highest product base margin (2.0K), suggesting they are most cost-effective for shipping. A deeper analysis of container usage efficiency could reveal further cost-saving opportunities.
o	Large containers have a minimal base margin (0.4K), indicating potential underutilization or inefficiencies in usage.
o	
3.	Total Units Sold by Product Container:
o	Small Boxes dominate sales (111K units), showcasing their popularity or suitability for most product types. However, Medium Boxes (25K) and Large Boxes (15K) could be optimized for handling larger or bulkier items.
